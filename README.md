JoshNative
==========

A Java wrapper around some C Win32 functions.

I made this a couple of years ago to do some cool things in my high school Java programming class.

Feel free to fork it and do stuff with it. It's licensed under the GNU LGPL.

#### NOTE: Java doesn't like 32-bit DLLs on 64-bit systems, so recompile the JoshNative.dll for the target arch.
